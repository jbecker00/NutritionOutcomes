# NutritionOutcomes
This research aims to assess the outcome malnutrition among hospitalized patients. Using publicly available data I aim to assess the correlation between environmental exposures (lead and cadmium as characterized by NYCHANES) and the risk of becoming malnourished based on census tract in New York City.
